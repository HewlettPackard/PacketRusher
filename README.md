# PacketRusher

![PacketRusher Logo](docs/media/img/PacketRusher.png)

----
## Description
PacketRusher is a tool, based upon [my5G-RANTester](https://github.com/my5G/my5G-RANTester), dedicated to the performance testing and automatic validation of 5G Core Networks using simulated UE (user equipment) and gNodeB (5G base station).

If you have questions or comments, feel free to open an issue.

PacketRusher borrows libraries and data structures from the [free5gc project](https://github.com/free5gc/free5gc).

## Features
* Simulate multiple UEs and gNodeB from a single tool
  * We tested up to 10k UEs!
* Supports both N2 (NGAP) and N1 (NAS) interfaces for stress testing
* --pcap parameter to capture pcap of N1/N2 traffic
* Implements main control plane procedures:
  * UE attach/detach (registration/identity request/authentification/security mode) procedures
  * Create/Delete PDU Sessions, up to 15 PDU Sessions per UE
  * Xn handover: UE handover between simulated gNodeB (PathSwitchRequest)
  * N2 handover: UE handover between simulated gNodeB (HandoverRequired)
  * UE Enter/Exit CM-IDLE procedures (Service Request) 
  * GUTI Re-registration
  * Supports 5G roaming: Tested with new https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/2194 Roaming feature
* Implements high-performant N3 (GTP-U) interface
  * Generic tunnel supporting all kind of traffic (TCP, UDP, Video…)
    * We tested iperf3 traffic, and Youtube traffic through PacketRusher
    * We roughly reach 5 GB/s per UE, which is more than what a real UE can achieve.
* Integrated all-in-one mocked 5GC/AMF for PacketRusher's integration testing

## Installation
### Quick start guide
The following is a quick start guide, for more details on the installation, configuration or usage, you may refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/PacketRusher/wiki).

### Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04-23.04, Debian 12 Bookworm
  - All Linux distibutions with kernel >= 5.4 should work, but untested.
  - There might be issues with frankenstein kernel from RHEL/CentOS/Rocky, feel free to open a bug if you encounter one!
- Windows is not supported (Windows does not support SCTP)
- Go 1.21.0 or more recent
- Root privilege
- Secure boot disabled (for custom kernel module)

PacketRusher is not yet supported on Docker.

### Dependencies
```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-generic make git wget tar linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)
# Warning this command will remove your existing local Go installation if you have one:
$ wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz && sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# Add go binary to the executable PATH variable:
$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> $HOME/.profile
```

### Download PacketRusher source code
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/PacketRusher # or download the ZIP from https://github.com/HewlettPackard/PacketRusher/archive/refs/heads/master.zip and upload it to your Linux server
$ cd PacketRusher && echo "export PACKETRUSHER=$PWD" >> $HOME/.profile
$ source $HOME/.profile
```

### Build free5gc's gtp5g kernel module
```bash
$ cd $PACKETRUSHER/lib/gtp5g
$ make clean && make && sudo make install
# Make sure you have Secure boot disabled if you are unable to install the custom Kernel module
```

### Build PacketRusher CLI
```bash
$ cd $PACKETRUSHER
$ go mod download
$ go build cmd/packetrusher.go
$ ./packetrusher --help
```

You can edit the configuration in $PACKETRUSHER/config/config.yml as specified [here](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/PacketRusher/wiki/Configuration), and then run a basic scenario using `sudo ./packetrusher ue` while in the $PACKETRUSHER folder.   
More complex scenarios are possible using `sudo ./packetrusher multi-ue`, see `./packetrusher multi-ue --help` for more details.   
For more details on the installation, configuration or usage, you may refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/PacketRusher/wiki).
